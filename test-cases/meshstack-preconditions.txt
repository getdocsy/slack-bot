Hi guys, I need a list of what we need for to run meshStack on an OpenShift cluster for IT NRW.
@malhussan
I can’t remember we sent the Bosch team a list. Do you know if we have one somewhere?

The only thing we need is admin access to an openshift cluster, besides that it depends on the their network setup (if proxy is needed)

Let’s create a list please somewhere so we have it available when we need it without need to ask someone.

Also if it turns out that we learn about more preconditions to include (which is usually the case from experience :slightly_smiling_face:), we can just add them.

Maybe we can add an entry for installing meshStacks (A list for SaaS vs a list for Enterprise) in our meshcloud docs. Something similar to what you already created

DNS and SSL Certificates · meshStack
During the setup of your meshStack you can choose which endpoints should be used.
